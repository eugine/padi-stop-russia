# PADI must close the office in Moscow and cancel all Russian dive centers' licenses

Diving has always been a way to relax, explore and collaborate with divers from all over the world. 

Unfortunately, starting from February 24, 2022 Ukrainian divers can not do this anymore. We had to run from our houses (since they got destroyed), hide in basements (due to missiles attacks) or take weapon in hands in order to protect our home. 

The reason for this is Russia and the unexplained aggression against Ukraine. War and diving are incompatible. The aggressor must be stopped. 

In such situation PADI can not stay aside and must take actions: 
1. Shutdown the office in Moscow
2. Cancel all Russian dive centers's licenses
